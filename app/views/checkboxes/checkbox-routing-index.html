      Branching dependent on checkboxes
    </h1>

      If one or more checkboxes are checked branch to page a, if no checkboxes are checked branch to page b.

      Idea/need from Ros - a list of existing people is displayed, the user selects all the people who meet the criteria.  If no one is selected when the page is submitted take the user to a page where they can add a new person.
    </p>

    <p>
      Previous designs asked the user to 1) tick another checkbox if none of the existing people met the criteria, and 2) a link to add another person to the list.  Testing the new idea with users seems to work better, so we now need to make something more realistic - that can be used without intervention
    </p>

    <p>
      Challenges were:

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the list of people is built dynamically - so we don't know how many checkboxes will be on the page - between 1 and 4.</li>
        <LI>we'd like code anyone could easily re-use in their proto - code easy to read and reuse
        <li>we don't have a working example to copy/adapt - the kit has <a href="/docs/examples/branching">a branching example for a radio group</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
      Try it
    </h2>
    <p>
      <a class="govuk-link" href="checkbox-list">checkbox list of people</a>
    </p>
    <p>full notes on how the routing code works are in the routes.js file</p>
    <p>ToDo:
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><del>make a working version with three checkbox</del></li>
        <li><del>build the number of checkboxes in the list dynamically (between 1 and 4) - as its currently hard coded</del></li>    
        <li>get Ros to try it in her prototype</li>     
      </ul>
    </p>
