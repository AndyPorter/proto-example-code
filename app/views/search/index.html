      <p>would be nice to be able to offer/prototype:
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>site search - search the pages/topics within the site/prototype</li>
          <li>search specific topic, an in service search. like searching a persons name to retrieve a list of people, or search for a case reference</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>would be nice to be able build the search ui so that:
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>you have an input box and a search button, submit it and produce a page of results</li>
          <li>an autocomplete control, that as you type the list of results appears in the dropdown part</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>I think i've seen somewhere, which would also be nice, is having a search index that contains alternate names for things (aliases?), so with a name search Andy and Andrew would bring back people with both</p> 

      <p>try it:
      	<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      		<li><a href="">to do</a></li>
		      <li><a href="">to do</a></li>
		    </ul>
		  </p>

    </div>
